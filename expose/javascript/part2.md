1. 3 because after the for loop, i increases to 3. 
2. 150 because discountedPrice gets to be updated by the last discounted price.
3. 150 because finalPrice gets to be updated by the last discounted price.
4. [50, 100, 150] because this function bascially is to convert the original price to the discounted price. After the calculation, all of the discounted price will be saved in a list called discounted.
5. Error because let is only visible inside the block.
6. Error because let is only visible inside the block.
7. 150 because finalPrice is defined in the function block. So it can be displayed within the discountPrices block.
8. [50, 100, 150] because this function bascially is to convert the original price to the discounted price. After the calculation, all of the discounted price will be saved in a list called discounted.
9. Error because let is only visible inside the block.
10. 3 because length is in the function block and it is the length of input variable prices.
11. [50, 100, 150] because push does not change the address of discounted.
12. A. student.name B. student["Grad Year"] C. student.greeting() D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A. 32 It basically convert 2 to string and do the concatenation.
    B. 1 JavaScript will attempt to convert "3" to a number before performing the subtraction operation. Since the string '3' can be successfully converted to the number 3, the expression will evaluate to 3 - 2, which equals 1.
    C. 3 JavaScript automatically converts null to 0 before performing the operation.
    D. 3null Because the first operand '3' is a string, so JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of addition.
    E. 4 true converts to number 1 before doing the addition
    F. 0 Both the boolean value false and the null value are converted to the number 0.
    G. 3undefined Because the first operand '3' is a string, so JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of addition.
    H. NaN JavaScript attempts to convert the string operand to a number before performing the subtraction. However, the string '3' can be converted to the number 3, and the undefined value cannot be converted to a number, so the result of the expression is NaN.
14. A. true The string '2' can be converted to the number 2, and 2 > 1 is true, so the result of the expression '2' > 1 is true.
    B. false JavaScript performs a lexicographic comparison between the strings. Since "2" is greater than "1", it is false.
    C. true JavaScript converts "2" to a number before making the comparison. So 2 is equal to 2.
    D. false === operator is the strict equality operator, and it compares two values for equality without performing type coercion. Therefore, "2" is not equal to 2.
    E. false JavaScript converted true to number 1 which is not equal to 2.
    F. true because both side are Boolean type.
15. The == operator compares two values for equality after performing type coercion, which means that it attempts to convert the operands to a common type before making the comparison. The === operator is the strict equality operator, and it compares two values for equality without performing type coercion.
16. [2,4,6] because in the for loop, when we call callback, it calls dosomething function and doubles the number. Then it pushes these elements into newArr.
17. 1432
